# Syntax

This is the file that allows Sublime Text 3 to support syntax highlighting for the Protocol description 
language.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up the syntax highlighting in your Sublime editor:
 - If not installed, install `Package Control` in Sublime.
 - Install `PackageDev` with your package control.
 - Click _Tools -> Packages -> Package Development -> New Syntax Definition..._
 - Paste the contents of [`protocol.sublime-syntax`](protocol.sublime-syntax) into the editor.
 - Save the file in the folder that the folder selector opens to as `protocol.sublime-syntax`.
 - If opening a \*.prtcls file does not show the syntax highlighted select `Protocol` as 
 the language in _View -> Syntax ->_
